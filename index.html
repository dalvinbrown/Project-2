          As a child, Dorian Banks was captivated by the show “Noah’s Arc,” a
          2005 cable dramedy that followed a cast of black, gay men living in
          Los Angeles. “I wanted to be just like them,” Banks, now 25, said. .
        </p>
        <p class="g-copy">
          He moved to New York from Detroit in his late teens, hoping to become
          a dancer. He settled in the Fordham section of the Bronx where he
          wound up lacking housing security, dabbling in sex work and living out
          a storyline from “Noah’s Arc” that he hadn’t planned for.
        </p>
        <p class="g-copy">
          O“I was diagnosed with HIV. I was ‘Junito,’” a character on the show,
          Banks said. Black men who have sex with men are far more affected by
          HIV than any other group in the United States. And CDC data suggests
          50% of them will contract the disease in their lifetime.

        
    
        </p>
        <p class="g-copy">
          In the Bronx, where HIV transmission rates are highest in the city,
          the community faces layers of inequalities that increase their
          likelihood of HIV infection. Still, Banks is represented among a more
          promising statistic: He caught the disease early.

          Between Banks’ diagnosis in 2014, and the latest data available in
          2017, timely initiation of care among HIV-positive people in the Bronx
          rose from 74% to 84%, according to the health department.
        </p>
        <p class="g-copy">
          Early diagnosis is one of the key drivers of successful treatment and
          it reduces the likelihood of further transmission, according to Oni
          Blackstock, assistant commissioner of HIV/AIDS prevention and control
          for the health department. Fewer than 10-years ago, testing a sample
          of blood for HIV took days. Today, rapid tests can complete the task
          in 20 minutes, Blackstock said.
        </p>
        <p class="g-copy">
          Testing facilities have also become easier to come during that time.
        </p>
        <p class="g-copy">
          Since 2007, the number of city-sponsored testing sites in the Bronx
          has doubled to more than 160, according to the health department.
          There are at least five HIV-testing centers in the Fordham area,
          including the Montefiore outpost that treats Banks.
        </p>
        <p class="g-copy">
          Housing stability also plays a vital role in both treating and
          preventing HIV among his peers. "Young, black and brown queer people
          are well represented, unfortunately, among the homeless population in
          the city,” Blackstock said. She spent 3-years conducting HIV research
          at Montefiore in the South Bronx and Fordham area. Gay people younger
          than 26 often lack family support and have difficulty accessing
          healthcare coverage without a parent. They also face homophobia and
          transphobia, Blackstock said.
        </p>
        <p class="g-copy">
          “These factors put young people in positions where they may be
          exchanging sex for money or for food, which puts them at risk for
          acquiring HIV and other (sexually transmitted diseases),” Blackstock
          said. Injection drug use is also a driver of HIV transmission among
          young, black men in the city's northernmost borough. Van Asher, who is
          the head of a syringe access program at St. Ann's Corner of Harm
          Reduction in the South Bronx, explained how government-sponsored
          programs curb HIV-infection rates among young adults through outreach.
          “Our outreach team will text them to remind them to come to their
          appointments, and some programs have late evening or weekend operating
          hours so people can come in when they’re out of school,” Asher said.
